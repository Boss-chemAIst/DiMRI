nanoparticles (using x = 0.43 as example) is as follows: 0.903 g (1 mmol) of iron oleate (synthesized
in a typical method) and 0.104 g (0.167 mmol) manganese oleate were dissolved in 15mL of
1-octadecene, with the addition of 0.186 mL (0.584 mmol) of oleic acid. The solution was first kept
at 120 °C for 30 min in vacuum to remove air and other impurities then refluxed at 320 °C in N2 for
2 h before cooling to room temperature. The products were separated by centrifugation, washed three
times with ethanol, and dispersed in hexane for further use. The preparation of Fe3O4 nanoparticles is
similar to the procedure without the adding of manganese oleate.","thermal decomposition",,,,,,,"",,"crystalline","inverse spinel structures of magnetite",,"TEM",,"-","0.3","18.5","18.5","18.5","18.5","spherical",,,,,,,,,"MTT","SMMC-7721","no","100",,,,,,,,,"300","50000","75.6","0","0",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"7","0.5","904.4",,,,,,,,,,,,,

oleylamine) in octyl ether (15 mL).1
 The reaction mixture was stirred at 300oC for 1 h and
then cooled to room temperature. Nanoparticles were collected by adding excess ethanol
and centrifugation and redispersed in toluene.
MnFe2O4@SiO2 nanoparticles with 16 nm SiO2 shell were synthesized using a slight
modification of a known method.2
 Polyoxyethylene(5)nonylphenyl ether (1.68 mmol,
Igepal CO-520, containing 50 mol % hydrophilic group) and 1.2 mg MnFe2O4 were
dispersed in cyclohexane and vortexed. Then, ammonium hydroxide (30%, 105 µL) was
added to form a transparent and brown reverse microemulsion. Next, tetraethyl
orthosilicate (92 µL, TEOS) was added and the emulsion was let stand for 72 h at room
temperature. When methanol was added to the reaction solution, MnFe2O4@SiO2
nanoparticles were precipitated and collected by centrifugation. To control the SiO2
thicknesses from 4 to 8, 12, and 20 nm, amount of TEOS were changed from 10 to 24, 51,

nanoparticles. The nanoparticles were separated by discarding supernatant and dispersed in hydrophobic
solvent such as n-hexane or chloroform. Finally the iron oxide nanoparticles were redispersed in

For the development of bimodal nanoprobe FePt-CdS, FePt MNP was
developed by a facile polyol process reported earlier [33]. In brief, 25 ml
ethylene glycol, 1.0 mmol platinum (II) acetylacetonate and 4 mmol sodium borohydride were added in a three necked flask under N2 atm. at
room temperature (Fig. 1(a)). After attaining the temperature 100 °C,
2 mmol iron (III) acetylacetonate was added along with 200 μl of surfactant TG acid. The solution in the N2 atm. was then heated up-to 190 °C at
the rate of 1 °C per min. After that, the solution was cooled down to
100 °C temperature under inert atmosphere. This as-prepared TG acid
capped FePt magnetic nanoparticles will act as the template for the developing bimodal nanoprobe (Fig. 1(b)). The next step of the reaction
was conducted in an open atmosphere. 2.5 mmol of cadmium chloride
monohydrate and 0.5 mmol of GSH were dissolved in 5 ml of ethylene
glycol separately, in the molar ratio 5:1 of Cd and GSH. The inert atmosphere of reaction vessel was replaced by the ambient condition, when
the reaction temperature came down to 100 °C. At first, the Cd precursor
was added in the reaction vessel at the temperature 100 °C. After
15 min, 0.5 mmol glutathione was mixed in the reaction vessel elevated
to a temperature of 120 °C, which acted as a capping agent as well as the
sulphur source for CdS growth. The pH was adjusted to 8.0 with stirring
(Fig. 1(c)). The reaction temperature was then further increased at the
rate of 1 °C/min to 230 °C. After attaining 230 °C, the heating was
stopped and the reaction vessel was allowed to cool down to room temperature for purification process (Fig. 1(d)). The purification was conducted in two steps - a) centrifugation followed by b) magnetic
separation. The purification was carried out to remove the residual surfactants by centrifugation using mixture of aliquot, hexane, isopropyl alcohol, and methanol in the ratio of 1:1:2:1 respectively. The magnetic
separation was carried out in centrifuged mass for obtain purified magnetic mass only; which was used for further characterizations.","Polyol",,,,,,,"",,"","FePt/CdS",,"TEM",,"",,,,,,"Sphere",,,,,,,,,"","","",,,,,,,,,,"300","90","3.8","0","0",,,,"5","300","100","54",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"14.1",,"0.9822",,,,,,,,,,,,,

double Au seeding approach. Small gold NPs, i.e., Au seeds,
were deposited on a SiO2
 surface in the first Au seeding step
by using the following procedure. First, to adjust the pH value
to 7, 0.1-M NaOH (anhydrous, >98%, Sigma Aldrich) was added
to 4 mL of 6.35-mM HAuCl4x3H2O (>99.9%, Alfa Aesar) in a

was seeded with Au(OH)3
 by mixing FePt/SiO2
 NPs with a

colour change from yellow to orange-brown indicates the
attachment of the Au(OH)3
 to the SiO2
 surface.23 The product
was then centrifuged (950 rpm/30 min) and washed several
times and finally dispersed in distilled water. In order to
achieve denser Au seeding, i.e., fill the gaps between the Au
seeds from the first run and to obtain a more uniform Au shell,
in the second step, a Au seeding step was repeated using the
same conditions as in the first Au seeding step. Hybrid
FePt/SiO2/Au NPs were functionalized with mPEG-SH (average
Mn 6000, Sigma Aldrich) using the following procedure. Into
the suspension of hybrid NPs in water (2 mL, 5 mg) 2 mL of

previously reported methods. Briefly, 1 mL of a 2 mg/mL stock solution of 9 nm oleic
acid coated Fe3O4 nanoparticles suspended in choloroform were added to a vial
containing 1 mL of 10 mg/mL mPEG – DSPE (MW = 5,000, Avanti, USA). After
evaporation of the solvent, the micelle-coated Fe3O4 nanoparticles were resuspended in 2
mL of PBS by sonicating at 70 °C for 5 to 10 min. The resulting solution was purified on
a sephadex column (GE Healthcare, USA) followed by three successive centrifugal
filtrations using a 100 kDa centrifuge filter at 6,000 RPM for 30 min. The final solution
was resuspended in 2 mL of PBS and syringe filtered through 0.22 µm PVDF filters
(Millipore, USA) to obtain Fe3O4 micelles that were 200 nm in diameter. To add a
fluorophore to the micelles, 100 µL of amino terminated PEG – DSPE and 900 µL of
mPEG – DSPE was used in the formation of the micelles. An NHS-conjugated Cy7
fluorescent label was then reacted with the micelles by gentle agitation at room
temperature for 4 h followed by purification and filtration procedures similar to those
used in the methoxyPEG-terminated micelle preparation.","",,,,,,,"",,"","Fe3O4",,"TEM",,"",,"15","15","15","15","Sphere",,,,,,,,,"","","",,,,,,,,,,"298","50","60",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"3",,"333",,,,,,,,,,,,,
