nanoparticles (using x = 0.43 as example) is as follows: 0.903 g (1 mmol) of iron oleate (synthesized
in a typical method) and 0.104 g (0.167 mmol) manganese oleate were dissolved in 15mL of
1-octadecene, with the addition of 0.186 mL (0.584 mmol) of oleic acid. The solution was first kept
at 120 °C for 30 min in vacuum to remove air and other impurities then refluxed at 320 °C in N2 for
2 h before cooling to room temperature. The products were separated by centrifugation, washed three
times with ethanol, and dispersed in hexane for further use. The preparation of Fe3O4 nanoparticles is
similar to the procedure without the adding of manganese oleate.","thermal decomposition",,,,"",,"","",,"crystalline","inverse spinel structures of magnetite",,"TEM",,"-","0.3","18.5","18.5","18.5","18.5","spherical","","","",,,,,,"MTT","SMMC-7721","no","100",,,,,,,,,"300","50000","75.6","0","0",,,,,,,,,"",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"7","0.5","904.4",,,,,,,,,,,,,

prepared solution was heated in the glass beaker using a hot plate (T ~
200 ◦C) for 4 h. During heating the solution became a viscous gel, which
self-combusted. The prepared brown-red ash was washed four times
with absolute ethanol and two times with deionized water. The final

The color of the solution changed from reddish-brown to transparent orange and finally brownish-black. Then the solution was cooled to room temperature and mixed with 30 mL of isopropanol to precipitate the nanoparticles. The nanoparticles were separated by centrifugation and washed three times with distilled water in a separatory funnel. After the hexane volatilized naturally, the iron-oleate complex was obtained as a waxy solid. Hot injection was used to carry out the Fe2+ to Mn2+ cation exchange reactions. Typically, 100 mg of MnCl2· 4H2O was dispersed in 6 mL of degassed oleylamine. After being degassed under a vacuum, the mixture was heated to 120 °C for 15 min to dissolve MnCl2·4H2O to form Mn precursor. After cooled room temperature, the mixture containing Mn precursor was injected into a degassed solution containing 20 mg of as prepared SPIO, 10 mL of 1-octadecene, 2 mL of oleyalmine, and 1 ml of tri-n-octylphosphine at 180 °C was kept at this temperature for 2 h. When the reaction was completed, the solution was cooled to room temperature and 30 mL of isopropanol was added to precipitate the nanoparticles. The nanoparticles were separated by centrifugation and washed three times with ethanol.

The commercial DSPE-mPEG2000 was used to modify the surface of NaHoF4 nanoparticles according to a reported method with a slight modification.47 Typical example: To coat 10 mg of NaHoF4 nanoparticles, about 0.5 mL solution (20 mg/ mL) was used and hexane was removed under argon flow and followed by adding 0.5 mL chloroform. About 10 mg of DSPE-mPEG2000 was dissolved in 1.5 mL of chloroform. The two chloroform solutions were mixed together and shaken for 15 min in a shaker. Then 4 mL of DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide) was added slowly to the mixture and shaken in a shaker for 30 min. Chloroform was removed by vaporization under vacuum. After that, 15 mL of deionized water was added slowly to the colloidal solution in DMSO. DMSO was substituted with deionized water by centrifuging in special centrifugal filter tubes (Vivaspin Turbo 15 100 kDa cutoff size) 3 times with water. NaHoF4 nanoparticles coated with DSPE-mPEG2000 were dissolved in 1 mL of deionized water at last.","",,,,"",,"","",,"","NaHoF4","","TEM","80","",,"16.4","16.4","16.4","16.4","Sphere","","","",,,,,"","","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"",,,,,"","","",,,,,"","","",,,,,"","",,"9.4","0.22","70.4",,,,"","",,"",,,,,,
